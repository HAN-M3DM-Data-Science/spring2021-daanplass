#What was the business problem? 

A supermarket moved in which would possibly cut a part of the customers the butcher has. 

The butchers didn't know how to use Big Data.


#How was it translated into a data mining problem? 

Through location based intelligence. 

Everybody carries phones with them which send out a signal to connect with Wifi or Bluetooth. 
This signal could be picked up to see the amount of people that walked by the shop. 


#What is the realized business value?

The butcher now knows how to use data and increase his sales and compete with other stores.

He does this through varius techniques
1. Camera monitoring -> what and where are people looking at in the store. 
2. Weather predictions -> extracting real time data from the internet and can forecast when he has to produce which types of products. 
3. Location based intelligence -> picking up signals from mobile device to track the number of customers walking past the stores. 

The realized business value is increased sales and a competitive advantage through AI technologies.
